                <b> Baked Tortilla Chips</b> <br>
                <i> Ingredients </i> <br>
                4 large soft tortillas <br>
                1½ Tbsp (22 mL) vegetable oil<br>
                ½ tsp salt<br>
                ¼ tsp paprika powder<br>
                ⅛ tsp ground black pepper<br><br>
                <i> Directions </i> <br>
                1. Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C). Cut each tortilla into 12 pieces and transfer the pieces to a large bowl.<br>
                2. Pour half the oil over the tortillas, toss, then add the remaining oil*. Toss again. Sprinkle over the salt, paprika, and pepper and mix again, ensuring all pieces have some seasoning on them.<br>
                3. Lay the pieces in a single layer* over two lined baking trays. Bake in the oven on the middle and lowest rack for 3 - 4 minutes. Rotate the pans and bake for another 3 - 4 minutes.<br>
                4. Remove from the oven when the edges of the chips are toasted. Keep an eye on them during baking because they can easily over toast.<br>
                5. Serve the chips with your favourite salsa, dip or spread and enjoy!

                <b> Chipotle Refried Beans </b> <br>
                <i> Ingredients </i> <br>
                2 Tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil<br>
                1 medium onion, chopped<br>
                3 cloves garlic, minced<br>
                2 tsp (4 g) ground cumin<br>
                1 tsp (2 g) paprika powder<br>
                1 vegetable bouillon cube<br>
                ½ tsp cayenne pepper<br>
                1 pinch ground black pepper<br>
                3 cups (513 g) cooked pinto beans<br>
                1½ cups (360 mL) water<br>
                1 Tbsp (15 mL) chipotle adobo sauce<br>
                ½ lime, juiced<br><br>
                <i> Directions </i> <br>
                1. To a large pan on medium-high heat add the oil and onions. Cook for 5 - 7 minutes, or until the onions are golden.<br>
                2. Next, add the garlic, cumin, paprika, bouillon cube, cayenne, and black pepper. Cook for 1 minute, breaking up the bouillon cube and letting the spices get fragrant and toasted.<br>
                3. Add the beans, water, and chipotle. Stir and simmer uncovered on medium heat for 10 minutes.<br>
                4. Transfer half of the cooked bean mixture to a tall container or bowl and blend with a immersion blender. Alternatively, blend in a regular standing blender until creamy and smooth. This step is optional.<br>
                5. Use a wooden spoon to roughly mash the remaining beans in the pan, leaving some texture.<br>
                6. Add the blended portion of the beans back into the pan of mashed beans, along with the lime juice and stir to combine.<br>
                7. Allow it to slightly cool before serving. Top with fresh cilantro and chopped onions if desired. Enjoy!

                <b> Spicy Garlic Tofu </b> <br>
                <i> Ingredients </i> <br>
                Tofu<br>
                16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, pressed<br>
                2 Tbsp (16 g) cornstarch <br>
                1 Tbsp (15 mL) vegetable oil<br>
                ½ tsp salt<br>
                ¼ tsp ground black pepper<br>
                Sauce<br>
                2 Tbsp (30 mL) maple syrup <br>
                1 Tbsp (15 mL) gochujang chili paste<br>
                1 Tbsp (15 mL) sodium-reduced soy sauce <br>
                1 Tbsp (15 mL) rice vinegar <br>
                Sautéed aromatics<br>
                2 Tbsp (30 mL) vegetable oil<br>
                5 cloves garlic, minced<br>
                1 medium shallot, diced <br>
                2 red hot chili peppers, thinly sliced<br>
                2 stalks green onion, thinly sliced<br><br>
                <i> Directions </i> <br>
                1. Ensure the tofu is sufficiently pressed before cutting it into 1 cm cubes.<br>
                2. Add the tofu cubes to a large bowl, along with the cornstarch, oil, salt, and pepper. Gently toss to coat.<br>
                3. Heat up a large pan over high heat and add the tofu, cook until golden on all sides, about 10 minutes. Try to not disturb the tofu too much to avoid crumbling.<br>
                4. Meanwhile, mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.<br>
                5. When the tofu is crisped to your liking, transfer it to a plate. Return the same pan to the heat, and add the oil. When hot, add the garlic, shallot, chilis, and green onion. Cook for 4 - 5 minutes.<br>
                6. Reduce the heat to medium-high and add the sauce, cooking for another 4 - 5 minutes or until the sauce becomes sticky.<br>
                7. Add the tofu to the pan, and stir to coat. Garnish, serve, and enjoy!

                <b> Buffalo Style Tofu Strips </b> <br>
                <i> Ingredients </i> <br>
                Tofu base<br>
                16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, pressed<br>
                ¼ cup (32 g) cornstarch <br>
                ½ cup (120 mL) unsweetened soy milk <br>
                ½ cup (54 g) breadcrumbs <br>
                1 tsp (2 g) paprika powder<br>
                ½ tsp ground cumin<br>
                ½ tsp garlic powder<br>
                ¼ tsp ground black pepper<br>
                Vegan ranch dip<br>
                ½ cup (120 mL) vegan mayonnaise<br>
                2 Tbsp (30 mL) unsweetened soy milk<br> 
                ¼ lemon , juiced<br>
                1 tsp (1 g) nutritional yeast flakes<br>
                1 tsp (1 g) dried parsley<br>
                ¼ tsp dried chives<br>
                ¼ tsp garlic powder<br>
                ¼ tsp onion powder<br>
                ⅛ tsp dried dill<br>
                ⅛ tsp salt<br>
                1 pinch ground black pepper<br>
                Buffalo sauce<br>
                ½ cup (120 mL) cayenne pepper hot sauce<br>
                ¼ cup (56 g) unsalted vegan butter <br>
                ½ tsp onion powder<br><br>
                <i> Directions </i> <br>
                1. Preheat the oven to 430°F (220°C) and line a baking tray. Cut the tofu into 3 inch x ½ inch (8 cm x 1 cm) sticks.<br>
                2. Prepare 3 shallow bowls: the first with cornstarch; the second with milk; and the third with the mixture of bread crumbs, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, and pepper.<br>
                3. Dip the tofu sticks in the cornstarch first to evenly coat in a thin layer. Brush off any excess clumps of cornstarch.<br>
                4. Then dunk the strips into the milk, letting any excess liquid drip off, before transferring the strips to the breadcrumb mixture. Roll to evenly coat.<br>
                5. Transfer the coated strips to the baking tray. Bake on the centre rack of the oven for 25 - 30 minutes, or until the sticks are golden, flipping once halfway.<br>
                6. Meanwhile, mix all the ranch dip ingredients in a jar.<br>
                7. Add the buffalo sauce ingredients to a saucepan on medium-high heat. Cook until the butter has melted, then remove from the heat.<br>
                8. When the tofu sticks have baked, remove them from the oven. When they are still warm but cool enough to handle, dip them into the buffalo sauce. Let any excess sauce drip off before transferring the sticks to a serving plate.<br>
                9. Serve the buffalo tofu sticks with the ranch, or serve in tortillas with your favourite fillings. Enjoy!

                <b> Veggie Skewers </b> <br>
                <i> Ingredients </i> <br>
                Tofu <br>
                16 oz (450 g) firm tofu, pressed<br>
                1 tsp (5 mL) olive oil<br>
                1 Tbsp (8 g) cornstarch (optional) <br>
                1 tsp (3 g) garlic powder<br>
                ½ tsp salt<br>
                ¼ tsp ground black pepper<br>
                Marinade<br>
                2 Tbsp (30 mL) olive oil<br>
                ½ lemon, juiced<br>
                ¼ tsp dried oregano<br>
                ¼ tsp dried thyme<br>
                ¼ tsp dried basil<br>
                ¼ tsp salt<br>
                ⅛ tsp ground black pepper<br><br>
                <i> Directions </i> <br>
                1. Soak about 20 - 25 wooden 7 inch (18 cm) skewers in a shallow dish of water for about 15 minutes. This will prevent the skewers from burning when they are baking. Preheat the oven to 390°F (200°C).<br>
                2. Cut the tofu into 1 inch (2 cm) bite-sized squares that are rather thin, but not too thin that they fall apart when threading through the skewer. If cut too thick, they won't crisp up as nicely.<br>
                3. Add the tofu to a large bowl, drizzle over the olive oil, and gently toss to coat.<br>
                4. Then add the cornstarch, garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and give it another gentle toss.<br>
                5. Add all the ingredients for the marinade to a bowl, and give it a mix.<br>
                6. Thread the tofu on the skewers along with the chopped veggies. Finish it with a cherry tomato on top!<br>
                7. Brush the marinade over the skewers, and place the skewers onto a wire rack. Place the rack into the centre of the oven, with a baking tray underneath to catch any liquid that drips off.<br>
                8. Bake in the oven for 25 - 30 minutes, or until the veggies are cooked to your liking. These skewers are delicious on their own, but we definitely recommend enjoying them together with our vegan tzatziki recipe! Enjoy!

                Bruschetta<br>
                1½ cups (224 g) cherry tomatoes, cut into quarters <br>
                ½ cup (12 g) fresh basil, thinly sliced<br>

                1 tsp (5 mL) oil from jar of sun-dried tomatoes <br>
                ½ Tbsp (4 g) capers, finely chopped<br>
                2 cloves garlic<br>
                1 tsp (2 g) onion powder<br>
                ¼ tsp salt<br>
                ¼ tsp ground black pepper<br>
                ½ cup (120 mL) balsamic vinegar<br>
                Toasted bread<br>

                1 Tbsp (15 mL) oil from jar of sun-dried tomatoes <br><br>
                <i> Directions </i> <br>
                1. In a bowl, combine the chopped tomatoes, basil, sun-dried tomatoes and oil, capers, garlic, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Set aside to allow the flavours to meld.<br>
                2. Make the balsamic reduction* by pouring the vinegar in a saucepan. Cook uncovered at a gentle boil until the volume reduces to about a quarter or third of the original volume, about 8 minutes. Stir often.<br>
                3. Brush both sides of the bread with the sun-dried tomato oil and toast on a frying pan on high heat, or in the oven on broil until the edges are golden.<br>
                4. Serve the bruschetta with the toasted bread, drizzle over a very small amount of the balsamic reduction, and enjoy!

                1. Rinse the rice until it runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions. When cooked, remove from the heat and keep covered with a lid for 5 minutes.<br>
                2. In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, and salt.<br>
                3. Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Lay the sweet potato planks on a baking tray and roast in the oven until cooked through, about 20 minutes, flipping halfway. Remove from oven and let cool before cutting into thin strips.<br>
                4. Transfer the cooked rice to a large shallow bowl. Pour over the sugar-vinegar mixture and gently mix it in while the rice is still warm. Then let the rice cool to room temperature.<br>
                5. Spoon some cooled rice on the rough side of a nori sheet and spread it out*. You should still be able to see some of the seaweed below the rice. Leave about 1 inch (2 cm) of space at the top of your sheet uncovered.<br>
                6. Place some veggies and mango strips in a line, about 1 cm above the bottom of your roll. Then roll it up! Wet the seaweed at the top of the roll with some water to help it secure the roll shut.<br>
                7. Use a sharp knife** to cut the rolls into bite-sized pieces. Enjoy!
